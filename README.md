### Description

Hey every one again well after 2 days of releseing R Quest 1 i relese R Quest 2 :D what does it do thats so good well now its more of a rpg maker that a map editor And now its Highly Commented

Mapper Features:

Endless tile support

No LAG!! At all runs perfectly fine on 1 ghz!

COLLISIONS!!!!

Fps

Map Scroling

Saveing and Loading

Game Runner:

Npc's!! really cool :D

npc movement they can follow u / move random

Scroling

Player Animation

Loading / Saveing of INI's

Players

Npc > Monsters (very basic tho they chase you thats about it lol)

Now this is how to use it when you have made a map useing my basic map editor copy the maps folder into the game directory overwrite the old 1 :) fairly basic so far then run the game.

Movement uses the arrow keys

Action = Space e.g your under a npc to talk to him press space

And there is a small Technical demo of the chaseing system

press the letter T whilst standing neer the 2 npc's by the tree one of them will chase you if you walk out of his boundtry which is 3 tiles arround him he will move randomly (this can be used for wiled monsters that attack you ect).

PLEASE VOTE AND POST YOUR RESONSES!!!!! I REALLY NEED FEEDBACK ON THIS OR ELSE R QUEST 3 WONT BE RELESED!!!
